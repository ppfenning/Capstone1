Overall, the abstract is well-written and meets all of the requirements for a capstone proposal abstract. You could improve the abstract by adding more detail about the CNN algorithm, the benchmark results, and the potential implications of the study.

Here is a revised version of the abstract that addresses these suggestions:

## Sample Abstract

This paper proposes a new algorithm for encrypting audio files using a chaotic neural network (CNN). The algorithm is benchmarked for its efficiency and effectiveness against two standard encryption methods, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). The CNN algorithm works by first converting the audio file to a waveform audio file format. The waveform audio file is then divided into small blocks, and each block is then encrypted using the CNN algorithm. The encrypted blocks are then recombined to form the encrypted audio file. {Sub one of the below:}

The results are expected to show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and effective than both AES and RSA, {but may be easier to crack.}  OR

The proposed CNN algorithm was benchmarked against AES and RSA using a variety of metrics, including encryption time, decryption time, and security. The results showed that the proposed algorithm was more efficient and effective than both AES and RSA. However, the proposed algorithm may be easier to crack than AES and RSA.

OR (encourage future work, instead of a weakness):

The proposed CNN algorithm is a promising new approach for encrypting audio files. It is more efficient and effective than AES and RSA, and it is able to learn complex patterns from data. However, further research is needed to improve the security of the proposed algorithm.
