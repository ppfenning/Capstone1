\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The world we live in has become wildly dependent on fast transfer of information.
Everything from our work and education to our entertainment and social life often requires the internet as a medium.
With this abundance of information, how can one ensure that their personal data remains private to bad actors?
Enter the field encryption, the process of encoding information.
Encryption allows one to take a plaintext message we wish to transmit and transforms it into a ciphertext.
Said ciphertext is illegible to those who do not have a \textit{key}.


Most modern encryption processes create a \textit{psuedo-random} key via a defined algorithm.
These algorithms can be broken into two schemes: \textbf{Symmetric-key Encryption} and \textbf{Public-key Encryption.}
Symmetric-key Encryption algorithms create a single secret-key which both the sender and receiver have.
This key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the message.
The security of this method directly depends on the holders of the key as anyone who has it can read the cipher.
Public-key Encryption algorithms require the message receiver to generate both a public and private key.
The receiver shares the public key with the trusted sender who uses it to encrypt a message.
Said message is sent to the receiver where the private key is used to decrypt it.
Because the private key is the only way to decipher the message, public-keys can be shared with impunity.
Though both methods do nothing to prevent the cipher from being intercepted by a third party, if the algorithm is strong enough, it should be illegible.


Billions of packets of information flow throughout the internet on a daily basis.
The larger the packet, the longer the encryption will.
In this paper we will develop our own algorithm to encrypt several audio files of varying.
The aforementioned algorithm will be developed using what is known as a \textbf{Chaotic Neural Network.}
This algorithm will be benchmarked for both efficiency and effectiveness against one symmetric-key method, \textbf{Advanced Encryption Standard} (AES), as well as one public-key method, the \textbf{Rivest–Shamir–Adleman} algorithm (RSA).

\section{Literature Review}\label{sec:literature-review}

\subsection{\textbf{Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems}}\label{subsec:chaos:-an-introduction-to-dynamical-systems}

Alligood~\cite{Alligood} provides an excellent course in the study of such dynamical systems.
She successfully explains chaotic phenomena in nature using Linear Algebra, Differential Equations and Numeric Analysis.
The book defines chaos as a field of study while introducing the idea of chaotic maps.
These maps are recursive in nature, and are highly sensitive to initial conditions.
Each iteration is mapped to a new phase-space for which the rate of separation of points in the sequence is directly related to the system's Lyapunov Exponents.
There is one exponent for each degree of freedom the chosen system has.
The scalar value of the exponent determines how the basis stretch ($LE > 1$) or shrink ($LE < 1$).
Sequences created by such maps, though deterministic, can be unstable.
These unstable sequences are known as chaotic orbits.
This instability is statistically indistinguishable in nature to randomness, making them ideal candidates for providinging repeatable pseudo-random arrays.
