  abstract     = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) denotes a network of interlinked sensors, instruments, and other devices for industrial applications in the domains of manufacturing, logistics, transportation, etc. IIoT security is a major crucial research area for several applications. Image encryption techniques gained popularity in the recent years, thanks to increasing requirements for secure image transmission in IIoT environments. At the same time, conventional security solutions built for sensitive data protection are getting outdated in IIoT environment due to the participation of third party. Blockchain (BC) is one of the recent solutions used for security purpose which eliminates the involvement of a third party. With this motivation, the current research article presents a new BC-Enabled Shark Smell Optimization with Hopfield Chaotic Neural Network (SSO-HCNN) for secure encryption in IoT environment. The proposed SSO-HCNN model exploits a composite Chaotic Map (CM) which is integrated into staged logistic and tent maps to initially process the images and develop the variables needed for Arnold mapping. In addition, the SSO algorithm is developed with maximum PSNR and coefficient fitness function to select the optimum secret and public keys of the system amongst the random numbers. Besides, the diffusion phase utilizes HCNN to create a self-diffusion chaotic matrix whereas the jumbled image performs XOR operation using the keys to obtain the cipher image. In SSO-HCNN model, the cryptographic pixel value in the image is saved on BC thus guaranteeing the security and privacy of the images. To examine the superior performance of SSO-HCNN model over state-of-the-art methods, a set of simulations was conducted on benchmark test images. The simulation results of the proposed SSO-HCNN model were promising under different evaluation parameters.},

  abstract       = {Problems such as insufficient key space, lack of a one-time pad, and a simple encryption structure may emerge in existing encryption schemes. To solve these problems, and keep sensitive information safe, this paper proposes a plaintext-related color image encryption scheme. Firstly, a new five-dimensional hyperchaotic system is constructed in this paper, and its performance is analyzed. Secondly, this paper applies the Hopfield chaotic neural network together with the novel hyperchaotic system to propose a new encryption algorithm. The plaintext-related keys are generated by image chunking. The pseudo-random sequences iterated by the aforementioned systems are used as key streams. Therefore, the proposed pixel-level scrambling can be completed. Then the chaotic sequences are utilized to dynamically select the rules of DNA operations to complete the diffusion encryption. This paper also presents a series of security analyses of the proposed encryption scheme and compares it with other schemes to evaluate its performance. The results show that the key streams generated by the constructed hyperchaotic system and the Hopfield chaotic neural network improve the key space. The proposed encryption scheme provides a satisfying visual hiding result. Furthermore, it is resistant to a series of attacks and the problem of structural degradation caused by the simplicity of the encryption system&rsquo;s structure.},

  abstract     = {Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the tasks have shifted to an online platform. Sectors such as e-commerce, sensitive multi-media transfer, online banking have skyrocketed. Because of this, there is an urgent need to develop highly secure algorithms which can not be hacked into by unauthorized users. The method which is the backbone for building encryption algorithms is the pseudo-random number generator based on chaotic maps. Chaotic maps are mathematical functions that generate a highly arbitrary pattern based on the initial seed value. This manuscript gives a summary of how the chaotic maps are used to generate pseudo-random numbers and perform multimedia encryption. After carefully analyzing all the recent literature, we found that the lowest correlation coefficient was 0.00006, which was achieved by Ikeda chaotic map. The highest entropy was 7.999995 bits per byte using the quantum chaotic map. The lowest execution time observed was 0.23 seconds with the Zaslavsky chaotic map and the highest data rate was 15.367 Mbits per second using a hyperchaotic map. Chaotic map-based pseudo-random number generation can be utilized in multi-media encryption, video-game animations, digital marketing, chaotic system simulation, chaotic missile systems, and other applications.},
